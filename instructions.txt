Problem:

A team in R&D at Oriflame has taken an interest in molecules coming from plants, as actives for future skincare products. They have found a natural product activity database called NPASS (https://bidd.group/NPASS-2018/index.php) which could help them in their investigations for plants of interest containing promising active ingredients. You can find a dataset coming from the NPASS database, containing the combination of plants and active compounds, in the file named "data_catalogue_NPASS_plant_compounds" (both in .xlsx and .csv).

In parallel, the R&D team has also downloaded more than 20000 .mol files (holding information about molecules) coming from natural sources according to NPASS. The analytical chemist in Oriflame R&D is requesting this vast collection of files to be stored on a computer (PC) in the lab so that these files can be read by the LC-MS (liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry) software. Since this piece of software is quite old, it cannot load more than 200 .mol files at a time. A toy dataset including more than 300 .mol files is available in the "mol files" folder.

Find a smart way to organize the files, for example in folders and subfolders that could be loaded into the LC-MS software, keeping in mind the limitations of the LC-MS software and that the main user will be an analytical chemist.
